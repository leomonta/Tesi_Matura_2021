I'm developing this project for my graduation on june 2021.

The idea is this:

I develop an http server in c++ that can receive request from the client, send request to an API and interface with a MySQL database.
I plan to use "api.randomuser.me" to fake the traffic on an international airport, my server send only some data to the client that requested it,
all whilst saving eveything on the DB
