# Project school for graduation

## I'm developing this project for my graduation on june 2021. I'll discuss this work on my exam
#### __I hope it will be the best part of the interrogation__


### The idea is this:

* I have a database containing different products from different suppliers, each supplier supply a specific product with a specific price,
each product and supplier are invented and have randomly generated data.

* I permit the use of the data in my database with an API available from my http server, the API support different values for searching products:
	* Name / part of the name of the product
	* Name / part of the name of the supplier
	* Maximum and Minimum price for the products
	* Category / tag of the product
	* part of the options of a product

> I also have a separate database for the mime types
